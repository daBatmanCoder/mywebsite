EXPLAINING REGARDING MY WEBSITE!


Hello, I wrote this website for Advanced Programming course, HW6, To run my website, 
just double-click the myWebsite.html file, it will open the corresponds website, just check that all the files, 
the styling- CSS and the javascript is in the folder, also the photos' folder, containing all the pictures the project has...


I wanted every language will be seperated in a different file, the HTML- MyWebsite.html 
the CSS- MyStyling.css and the Javascript in MyScripts.js so everything is organized.

I hope you like what I did here, I putted many hours on this project, including learning new skills
for me to implement in this website, 

To summary what I did briefly in Jave Script:

- I did a game in the Working Section- 
a simple 3 step game, that uses many function- and changes styling from the css document.

-I did a "top" button, that on scroll will pop up and then if you get to the top it is hidden.

- I did a changing slideshow manual function- on the "Trip" section, where everytime you press a button-
right or left it will change the photo, if the limit of the photo get to the end of the pictures list
then it will set the index to the first photo, and the same happens to the first photo to the last...

- I wrote the e-mail opener function, after validating everything is ok, with regex and required fields...
then I know that the user as a mail, and then I open his own mail and everything he wrote on my website is
deployed there, subject and message and my mail, only left the user to click send!!!

In the general case of the CSS file I wrote many functions and classes regarding the styling of the text,
headers, menu bar, etc... all of this made a lot of effort to keep track so in one moment i decided to just 
add a bunch of classes everytime I need to style something...
